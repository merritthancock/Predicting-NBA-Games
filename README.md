CS4731: Predicting NBA Game Outcomes using Linear Regression and Naive Bayes Classification

Just how much better are computers at predicting the outcome of sports matches?
For this project, we tried to answer this question by using Python to build a Naive Bayes Probabilistic Classifier to predict the outcome of any given NBA match-up. Additionally, we used Linear Regression to get a better idea of what statistics best translate to better team performance.
For more information and further clarification, see the attached writeup within the repository.
